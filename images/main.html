							My story begins in Northeast Ohio where I was born and raised (yes it’s one of those stories). I have three brothers, one older and two younger. When I was young, I would always tinker with things and take everything apart that I could get my hands on. Before I was 13 I taught myself BASIC on my brother’s computer, before I took that apart too.
							<br><br>I went to private school most of my life and played multiple sports every year. Eventually I found myself enrolled at The University of Toledo for Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science and Technology. While in college I partook in many philanthropies such as roadside beatifications, feeding the hungry, and volunteering at children's clinics. I also joined the Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity my freshman year. 
							<br><br>After college I ended up joining the workforce just after the 2008 recession (FYI I highly recommend not looking for a job during a recession). Not being able to find a career in my field, I resorted to finding smaller jobs such as landscaping and working at the local hardware store. After a year I realized I was being overlooked when applying for jobs for the younger college graduates. Realizing I was no longer employer competitive I went back to school at Lakeland Community College to brush up on old skills and learn some new ones. After taking a few courses I left as a Mechanical Designer with many certifications under my belt including being a certified Solid Works professional. 
							<br><br>With these tools I eventually found employment at The Lincoln Electric Company in 2011 as a Draftsman / Designer in the Mature Products group. While in this position I became bored and started tinkering once again. I eventually got in trouble for diagnosing, taking apart, and fixing multiple welders in the R&D lab. As punishment my boss assigned me to work in a brand new group with two other people working on a new product known as the VRTEX 360 Virtual Welder. In this group we worked long hours against absurd deadlines with very little help. But we also had very little oversight and a boat load of funds at our disposal. At the time I was perfect for this role. In a dark corner of an unoccupied building with no offices, desks, or even drywall, we designed and developed a product line that would eventually go on to sell two million dollars’ worth of machines in a month. The majority of my patents where founded working on these machines. 
							<br><br>After three years of working for this group I was pushed to advance in the company and eventually took a job in the Plant Engineering Department as a Mechanical Designer for our consumable division. In this role I was responsible for designing protective guarding and reliability fixes for machines, and developing ways to make them run faster as well as installing new production lines. While there I implemented millions of dollars in cost savings spread over my time in this facility. But eventually I worked myself out of a job and had nothing to do. With this spare time I bought many Arduino's and Raspberry PI's as well as a personal 3D printer I use at home. And eventually taught myself how to code. But after those three years I reapplied back to the VRTEX group to work for my favorite boss as the Lead Technologist II. In the time I was away the group developed into a nine person department and had a lot more support and backing. Just as I began again in this department the company decided to invest 30 million dollars into a state of the art welding and technology training center that was oriented around our VRTEX product line. 
							<br><br>In my final role at Lincoln Electric I would design, prototype, and test new products, as well as lend production support to our older products. Of those products I have been the project manager on two of them. I am also responsible for the operation of our 3D printers and plasma cutters.
